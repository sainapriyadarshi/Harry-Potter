       Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets: Spoiler Alert: The following text has a spoiler from the book; if you do not wish to see this, skip ahead and pretend that there's nothing here :) For those who enjoy spoilers, please hover your mouse over the text below to see the summary. <span class = "spoiler-text">  Summary: After a particularly horrible summer at home with the Dursleys, Harry can’t wait to return to Hogwarts for his second year. Banished to his bedroom, Harry receives a visit from an elf named Dobby, who warns him that he must not return to the school, for great danger awaits him there. Finally, he is rescued from his bedroom prison by Ron and his brothers in their flying car. Despite Dobby’s warnings, Harry returns to Hogwarts and stumbles right into the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets. On Halloween night, Harry, Ron and Hermione find a message painted on a wall that reads, “The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of the Heir, beware.” They soon discover that the Chamber of Secrets contains a deadly monster, that it hasn’t been opened for 50 years, and that the last time it was opened, someone died. “The heir” in the message refers to a descendant of one of the school’s four founders, Salazar Slytherin, who had a liking for the dark side of magic. Apparently, only Slytherin’s heir would be able to open this Chamber of Secrets and use the monster within to cleanse the school from all “Muggle-borns” and “halfbloods” whom he felt were unworthy to study magic. Suddenly, students who don’t come from “pureblood” wizarding families begin turning up petrified. Harry and his friends must solve the mystery before the monster goes beyond petrifaction and kills again. At the end of this story Harry again meets and defeats Voldemort, who has found another body to inhabit, and another life to feed off. Again, Harry defeats You-Know-Who. </span>

        Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban: Spoiler Alert: The following text has a spoiler from the book; if you do not wish to see this, skip ahead and pretend that there's nothing here :) For those who enjoy spoilers, please hover your mouse over the text below to see the summary. <span class = "spoiler-text"> Summary:  Harry ends another insufferable summer at the Dursleys and hears about an escaped murderer, Sirius Black, in the Muggle news. The wizarding world is also buzzing about the infamous Sirius, who had been held at Azkaban, a maximum-security prison for those who have committed severe crimes. Mr. Weasley warns Harry that Sirius is after him. At Hogwarts, Dumbledore informs students that the school will be guarded by the dreaded Dementors, Azkaban guards who can suck the souls out of wizards. Hermione displays strange behavior and seems to be enrolled in every single class, even those with conflicting times. Harry, Hermione and Ron enroll in Professor Trelawny's Divination class and Hagrid's Care of Magical Creatures class. Harry loses the first Quidditch match of the season when Dementors storm the field in search of Sirius. When he learns that Sirius betrayed his parents and are to blame for their death, Harry vows to kill him. But Harry soon discovers that Peter Pettigrew — once a good friend to Harry's parents and Sirius — was in fact responsible for betraying the Potters' whereabouts to Voldemort. Sirius, it turns out, is actually Harry's godfather. The Dementors find Sirius and are about to suck his soul when Hermione magically turns back time. Harry then conjures a powerful Patronus charm to save Sirius. Still a wanted wizard, Sirius goes into hiding, and Harry returns to the Dursleys. </span>
