           Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire: Spoiler Alert: The following text has a spoiler from the book; if you do not wish to see this, skip ahead and pretend that there's nothing here :) For those who enjoy spoilers, please hover your mouse over the text below to see the summary. <span class = "spoiler-text"> Summary: Harry has a nightmare from the perspective of Frank Bryce, Muggle caretaker of an abandoned mansion known as the Riddle House.He is killed by Lord Voldemort after stumbling upon him and Wormtail. Harry is awoken by his scar hurting. The Weasleys invite Harry and Hermione Granger to the Quidditch World Cup, to which they travel using a Portkey, meeting Cedric Diggory, a Hufflepuff sixth-year, on the way. In the match, Ireland beats Bulgaria, despite the skill of Bulgaria's seeker, Viktor Krum. Ministry of Magic employees at the World Cup discuss a missing Ministry worker. After the match, masked Death Eaters, followers of Voldemort, attack the camp site, causing terror and hurt the Muggle campsite owners. The Dark Mark is fired into the sky, causing extreme panic. Harry discovers that his wand is missing. It is later found in the possession of Winky, Barty Crouch's house elf, having been used to cast the Mark. Although few believe Winky could have conjured the Mark,Barty Crouch frees Winky from his service. At Hogwarts, Professor Dumbledore announces that "Mad-Eye" Moody will be the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher for the year. Dumbledore announced that Hogwarts will host the Triwizard Tournament, in which a champion of Hogwarts will compete against champions from two other European wizarding schools: Beauxbatons Academy, and Durmstrang. The champions are chosen by the Goblet of Fire from names dropped into it. Because Harry is under 17, he is not allowed to enter. At Halloween, the Goblet of Fire picks Fleur Delacour from Beauxbatons, Viktor Krum from Durmstrang, and Cedric Diggory from Hogwarts to compete in the tournament. Unexpectedly, it also chooses Harry as a fourth champion. Despite anger from the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang contestants, Harry is forced to compete in the tournament. Few believe Harry's protests that he didn't put his name in; Ron, who is jealous of Harry, accuses him of lying and breaks their friendship. In their first Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson, Professor Moody introduces the class to the Unforgivable Curses: the Imperius Curse, through which a wizard can be controlled as another wills; the Cruciatus Curse, which causes immense pain; and Avada Kedavra, the killing curse. A reporter, Rita Skeeter, starts writing untrue articles about Harry in The Daily Prophet. Because of the Prophet's large amount of readers, her words sway the  wizarding population's thoughts on Harry Potter. Hagrid secretly reveals to Harry that the first task in the tournament is to get past a dragon. Madame Maxime, headmistress of Beauxbatons, and Professor Karkaroff, headmaster of Durmstrang, also discover this. Sure that they will tell their champions, Harry informs Cedric about the dragons out of thoughts on fairness. Harry struggles to think of a way past a dragon, until Moody suggests flying. Hermione helps him to perfect his Summoning Charm, which he uses to summon his Firebolt and fly past the dragon to retrieve a golden egg, receiving high points from the judges. Ron and Harry reunite. Ron understands the danger of the tournament. Harry's egg is supposed to contain a clue to the next task, but when opened it shrieks loudly. Hermione, outraged by Barty Crouch's treatment of Winky, speaks to the house elfs in the school kitchen as part of a campaign for house elf's treatment. She takes Harry and Ron there to meet Dobby, who now works there. Dobby is the only house elf to appreciate his freedom, despite his hardworking nature. The others reject Hermione's idea of payment and holidays, which they find unbelieveable. The students are told of the Yule Ball, a Triwizard Tournament tradition, which requires Harry to find a partner with whom to open the dance. He asks Cho Chang, but she already agreed to go with Cedric. Afterwards, Harry asks Parvati. Hermione, offended that Ron did not consider her except as a last resort, attends with Viktor Krum, causing Ron to be jealous. At the ball, Cedric tells Harry to take the egg into the bath in the prefects' bathroom to work out the clue. Rita Skeeter writes an article revealing Hagrid's half-giant blood, which is looked down on in the wizarding world. After Hermione confronts her, Skeeter writes articles with bad things about Hermione.  After lots of rude mail, Hermione promises revenge on Skeeter. The trio secretly meet Sirius at Hogsmeade, who tells them that Barty Crouch was obsessed with catching and punishing dark wizards. This ended in Crouch sending his own son to Azkaban, where he died. Sirius thinks someone is trying to attack Harry through the Tournament. He suspects Karkaroff, who is a former Death Eater. Acting on Cedric's tip, Harry takes the egg to the prefects' bathroom by night, and with help from Moaning Myrtle, he discovers that the task is to recover something he loves from Merpeople at the bottom of the lake. While sneaking back to Gryffindor Tower under his invisibility cloak, he sees Barty Crouch in Snape's office on the Marauder's Map, despite Crouch being too ill to judge the Triwizard Tournament. While investigating, Harry falls into a trick step and drops the egg, which attracts Filch, Snape; who has had potion ingredients stolen, and Moody. Moody's magical eye sees Harry under his cloak. Moody covers for him, then borrows the Marauder's Map. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are unable to find a way to survive underwater for the second task, leaving Harry worried. On the morning of the task, Dobby gives him Gillyweed,having overheard about it in a conversation involving Moody. The Gillyweed lets Harry to find Ron at the bottom of the lake. However, he refuses to leave the other champions' hostages behind, and rescues Fleur's sister when Fleur doesn't come. Although Harry finishes last, he is awarded high marks for 'moral fiber'. One month before the final task,Harry and Krum are talking near the Forbidden Forest when they encounter Barty Crouch, who stopped appearing to work at the Ministry several months ago. Seeming insane, he claims to have done 'something terrible', that Bertha Jorkins is dead, and begs for Dumbledore. Leaving Krum with Crouch, Harry gets Dumbledore but returns to find Krum stunned and Crouch gone, with Krum claiming that Crouch attacked him from behind. Moody gives chase but does not find Crouch. During a Divination lesson, Harry experiences another dream involving Voldemort punishing Wormtail for a 'mistake.' Harry tells Dumbledore about this, and stumbles upon a memory-keeping device in Dumbledore's office, a Pensieve. Inside the Pensieve, he discovers that Barty Crouch's son was sent to Azkaban for helping to torture Neville Longbottom's parents. Harry prepares for the final task, a hedge maze filled with dangerous creatures and obstacles, the goal being to reach the Triwizard Cup at the center. Inside the maze, Harry stuns Krum, who was using the Cruciatus Curse on Cedric. Helping each other, Harry and Cedric reach the Cup at the same time. They agree to touch it at the same time and become joint winners. However, on touching it, they discover that it is a Portkey that transports them to a graveyard. There, Wormtail appears, kills Cedric, and ties up Harry. Wormtail uses Harry's blood, Tom Riddle Sr.'s bone, and his own hand to restore Lord Voldemort to a body. Voldemort summons his Death Eaters, berates them for believing him dead, and mentions that he has a 'faithful servant' at Hogwarts, who has led Harry there. He tortures Harry, then challenges him to a duel. However, when he and Harry fire spells at each other, their wands connect unexpectedly, causing echoes of Voldemort's previous magic to appear, including manifestations of Cedric and Harry's parents. These echoes provide a distraction for Harry, who escapes with Cedric's body to the Cup, which takes him back to Hogwarts. Under the panic caused by his arrival, Moody takes a traumatized Harry to his office. He reveals himself to be Voldemort's 'faithful servant', having put Harry's name into the Goblet of Fire, and guiding him throughout the tournament to ensure he would touch the Cup first. As Moody prepares to kill Harry, Dumbledore, McGonagall, and Snape intervene and stun Moody. Slowly, Moody changes appearance to become Barty Crouch Jr., the supposedly long-dead son of Barty Crouch Sr., who was using Polyjuice Potion to impersonate Moody. Using Veritaserum, they learn that Barty Crouch Sr. rescued his son from Azkaban as a favour to his dying wife: the Crouch Jr. who died in Azkaban was his mother, disguised under Polyjuice Potion. Crouch Jr. was kept imprisoned at home. Winky convinced Crouch Sr. to allow Crouch Jr. to see the Quidditch World Cup, where he stole Harry's wand, escaped, and conjured the Dark Mark. Wormtail, meanwhile, had captured Bertha Jorkins, who had once seen Crouch Jr. at home and been bewitched to forget. This allowed Voldemort to discover Crouch Jr.'s whereabouts, then formulate a plan to install Crouch at Hogwarts and lead Harry to him. Crouch Sr. was imprisoned by Wormtail, and when he escaped to Hogwarts, Crouch Jr. killed him. Dumbledore explains that Harry's and Voldemort's wands connected because they share a core of a feather from the same phoenix, coincidentally Dumbledore's own phoenix Fawkes. Dumbledore announces Lord Voldemort's return to the school. However, many people, including Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge, refuse to believe it. As the Dementor's Kiss was performed on Crouch Jr., he is unable to testify for Voldemort's return. Dumbledore puts his own plans against Voldemort into action. Hermione discovers Rita Skeeter is an unregistered Animagus who can take the form of a beetle, allowing her to eavesdrop on secrets. She blackmails Skeeter to force her to stop writing her stories. Not wanting his tournament winnings, Harry gives them to Fred and George to start their joke shop, and returns home with the Dursleys.</span>
